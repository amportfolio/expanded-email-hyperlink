	<h1 class="textCenter">Expanded Email Hyperlink</h1>
	<p class="textCenter version">Version 1.0 by Alex Moschopoulos</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>For something so simple as a email hyperlink, the current experience often doesn&rsquo;t fit with what users have been doing in the desktop space. I myself use Gmail, so while sending an email from mobile is as simple as a click, I&rsquo;m often copying email addresses and bringing them to Gmail.com on my laptop.</p>
	<p>Adham Dannaway&rsquo;s use of a tooltip and some JavaScript inspired me to create a better experience, as his doesn't account for mobile users. jQuery is needed though for this.</p>
	<p>The system uses mobile detection to determine if the user is on a mobile device, or a laptop (or desktop). A desktop/laptop user would see a tooltip when hovering over the hyperlink. If he clicks, then an email address is copied into the user&rsquo;s clipboard, and he can paste it into his email client (or site) of choice. If the user is on a mobile device, the tooltip functionality is turned off and the JavaScript will make the link act like any normal <em>mailto</em> hyperlink</p>
	<h2>Example</h2>
	<p>Feel free to send an <a onclick="emailHandler('#myAddress')" id="emailLink" tooltip-content="Click to copy my email address to your clipboard.">email</a>.<span id="myAddress" class="vanish">name@email.com</span></p>
	<h2>Setup and Configuration</h2>
	<p>The download contains an html file for the setup, a JavaScript file for the functionality, and both SCSS and CSS files for the styling. Bear in mind the tooltip is powered by CSS.</p>
	<p>Beyond changing the text to anything you like to say, the only other real configuration is setting up your email address in two areas. First there&rsquo;s a <em>span</em> in the HTML page: 
	<div class="grayCell code addMarginBtm2">
		&lt;<span class="dkBlue">span</span> <span class="ltBlue">id=</span><span class="red">&quot;myAddress&quot;</span> <span class="ltBlue">class=</span><span class="red">&quot;vanish&quot;</span>&gt;name@email.com&lt;/<span class="dkBlue">span</span>&gt;
	</div>
	<p>This is necessary as an item for the JavaScript to copy into the clipboard when one clicks on the link. Then there is also the email address in the JavaScript:</p>
	<div class="grayCell code addMarginBtm2">
		var <span class="red">email</span> = &apos;<span class="ltBlue">name@email.com</span>&apos;;
	</div>
	<p>Now you can change the message of the tooltip. You first need to fix it in the HTML:</p>
	<div class="grayCell code addMarginBtm2">
		<span class="ltBlue">tooltip-content=</span><span class="red">&quot;Click to copy my email address to your clipboard.&quot;</span>
	</div>
	<p>That is for the initial showing of the tooltip. The functionality to switch messages when a user clicks is in the JavaScript:</p>
	<div class="grayCell code addMarginBtm2">
		$(<span class="green">&quot;#emailLink&quot;</span>).attr(<span class="ltBlue">&apos;tooltip-content&apos;</span>,<span class="red">&apos;My email address is in your clipboard.&apos;</span>);<br>
		$(<span class="green">&quot;#emailLink&quot;</span>).mouseleave(function(){<br>
		<span class="sinIndent">$(<span class="green">&quot;#emailLink&quot;</span>).attr(<span class="ltBlue">&apos;tooltip-content&apos;</span>,<span class="red">&apos;Click to copy my email address to your clipboard.&apos;</span>);</span><br>
		});
	</div>
